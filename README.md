# Webshare Proxy Generator

Thank you to the original creator for providing the basis of my code.

This is an open-source, mass generator to generate Webshare.io proxies. The proxies generated are within a user:pass@ip:port format.

Unlike the original generator, this updated one will not be ratelimited because it randomly uses the new proxies generated to create more and more accounts.

## Requirements

Limited knowledge of anything is required to run this generator. You do require a paid api key from [Capsolver](https://www.capsolver.com) (more Captcha services coming soon).

## Setup

1. cd into the folder you want to download this to
2. then, run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lanadawlrey/WebshareProxyGen.git
3. Open up the "config.json" file
4. Input your Capsolver API key into the parentheses. SAVE THE FILE.
5. In command prompt, cd into the 'WebshareProxyGen' folder
6. Run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
